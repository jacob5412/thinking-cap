Hi! Welcome to my Blog!

I currently have no target audience; as the name suggests, this blog is an attempt to note my daily thoughts. I'm highly extroverted, and writing a blog was my attempt to record my thoughts and waste less time talking. 🙊

My main topics of discussion are typically going to be around:
- Productivity, motivation, and life-hacks
- Graduate Record Examination (GRE): An examination for pursuing a master's in the US 🇺🇸
- Data Science & Engineering (DSE)
- Chores and ways to do them effectively
- Exercise & living healthy 🏃‍♂️

Blogging would make me more healthy, patient, and productive. By the end of next month, I'll be less fidgety and more patient by delaying gratification.
